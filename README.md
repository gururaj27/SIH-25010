## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
The proposed solution is to design and implement a WhatsApp-based Smart Advisory Bot that functions as a digital agricultural companion for small and marginal farmers. The bot leverages the familiarity of WhatsApp, a platform already used by millions of rural Indians, thereby removing the barrier of new app adoption and ensuring quick scalability.

Farmers will be able to interact naturally with the bot through multiple input modes—text messages, voice commands, and image uploads. For instance, a farmer can send a photo of a diseased plant, and the system will analyze it using computer vision models to detect possible pests or diseases and suggest appropriate, low-cost treatment options. Similarly, they can ask questions via voice in their native language, and the bot will reply with simple, localized, and actionable advice.

The advisory system will be context-aware, tailoring responses to each farmer’s location, crop history, soil condition, and real-time weather data. For example, before recommending fertilizer, the bot can cross-reference the farmer’s soil health data, preventing overuse of chemicals and reducing costs. Integration with weather APIs ensures that the bot can push early warnings about rainfall, droughts, or pest outbreaks, allowing farmers to take preventive measures rather than reacting too late. Additionally, by linking with market price databases (like eNAM and local mandis), the bot can help farmers decide when and where to sell their produce for maximum profit.

The system will be multilingual and voice-enabled, ensuring accessibility for farmers with limited literacy. Regional dialects will be supported through NLP (Natural Language Processing) models trained on local languages. The interface will be designed to deliver short, clear, and practical advice rather than technical jargon, making the solution highly farmer-friendly.

## Technical Approach
The system will be powered by the WhatsApp Business API connected to an AI-driven backend hosted on the cloud. For natural conversations, NLP models trained in regional languages will be used, while computer vision models (such as CNNs) will handle pest and disease detection from uploaded images. APIs from IMD (Indian Meteorological Department), soil health card databases, and mandi price platforms will be integrated for real-time data. To ensure inclusivity, the backend will support both text-to-speech (for voice replies) and speech-to-text (for farmer queries). Security and scalability will be maintained through cloud platforms like AWS or GCP with load balancing, while offline fallback options such as SMS-based alerts may be added where internet connectivity is weak.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is highly feasible because WhatsApp is already the most used communication tool in rural India, requiring no new learning curve. Affordable smartphones and rising 4G/5G penetration further support adoption. AI models for pest detection, regional language NLP, and weather forecasting are already available and can be customized to Indian farming needs. Financial viability can be achieved through a freemium model—basic advisories free for farmers, while advanced analytics and integrations can be funded by government schemes, NGOs, agri-input companies, or cooperatives. Moreover, government initiatives like Digital India and eNAM create strong alignment for partnerships and scale-up.
## Impact and Benefits
This solution has the potential to transform farming practices for 86% of Indian farmers who are small and marginal. It will enable 20–30% higher crop yields through better advisory and significantly reduce fertilizer and pesticide misuse, lowering input costs. By providing localized, real-time guidance, it minimizes crop losses due to weather shocks or pest outbreaks. Farmers gain better market access through price alerts, increasing their income and reducing exploitation by middlemen. Environmental sustainability will also be promoted by reducing chemical overuse and preserving soil health. Beyond direct benefits, the platform can also act as a data-driven policy tool for governments and NGOs by highlighting regional crop issues and helping target interventions more effectively.
